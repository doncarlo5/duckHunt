### [Play the game](duck-hunt-seven.vercel.app) 🎮

## Introduction

This is my first project for my BootCamp IronHack. I get inspired by the famous video game Duck Hunt on NES.
This game is a browser-based game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

### Goal

The goal of this project was to create an engaging and challenging game that runs and deploys in a browser. The game is crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Adorable ducks
- Challenging difficulty levels
- Abundance of randomness (apparitions and type of ducks)
- Multiple css animations

## Key Features

- 👾 **Set Interval**: method used to display ducks.
- 🏎 **Velocity**: Initial value 3. Each next level, this velocity is multiply by 1.5, increasing difficulty.
- 🎲 **Random Frequency**: This random value is used to control the frequency of creating new ducks in the game.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Designed for landscape mode, with a warning for portrait mode.
